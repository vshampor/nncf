.. py:class:: NNCFConfig(*args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`dict`

   Contains the configuration parameters required for NNCF to apply the selected algorithms.

   This is a regular dictionary object extended with some utility functions, such as the ability to attach well-defined
   structures to pass non-serializable objects as parameters. It is primarily built from a .json file, or from a
   Python JSON-like dictionary - both data types will be checked against a JSONSchema. See the definition of the
   schema at https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/nncf/schema/, or by calling NNCFConfig.schema().

   .. py:method:: from_dict(nncf_dict)
      :classmethod:

      Load NNCF config from a Python dictionary. The dict must contain only JSON-supported primitives.

      :param nncf_dict: A Python dict with the JSON-style configuration for NNCF.


   .. py:method:: from_json(path)
      :classmethod:

      Load NNCF config from a JSON file at `path`.

      :param path: Path to the .json file containing the NNCF configuration.


   .. py:method:: register_extra_structs(struct_list)

      Attach the supplied list of extra configuration structures to this configuration object.

      :param struct_list: List of extra configuration structures.


   .. py:method:: get_redefinable_global_param_value_for_algo(param_name, algo_name)

      Some parameters can be specified both on the global NNCF config .json level (so that they apply
      to all algos), and at the same time overridden in the algorithm-specific section of the .json.
      This function returns the value that should apply for a given algorithm name, considering the
      exact format of this config.

      :param param_name: The name of a parameter in the .json specification of the NNCFConfig, that may
        be present either at the top-most level of the .json, or at the top level of the algorithm-specific
        subdict.
      :param algo_name: The name of the algorithm (among the allowed algorithm names in the .json) for which
        the resolution of the redefinable parameter should occur.
      :return: The value of the parameter that should be applied for the algo specified by `algo_name`.


   .. py:method:: schema()
      :staticmethod:

      Returns the JSONSchema against which the input data formats (.json or Python dict) are validated.



.. py:class:: Dataset(data_source, transform_func = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`Generic`\ [\ :py:obj:`DataItem`\ , :py:obj:`ModelInput`\ ]

   Wrapper for passing custom user datasets into NNCF algorithms.

   This class defines the interface by which compression algorithms
   retrieve data items from the passed data source object. These data items are used
   for different purposes, for example, model inference and model validation, based
   on the choice of the exact compression algorithm.

   If the data item has been returned from the data source per iteration and it cannot be
   used as input for model inference, the transformation function is used to extract the
   model's input from this data item. For example, in supervised learning, the data item
   usually contains both examples and labels. So transformation function should extract
   the examples from the data item.

   :param data_source: The iterable object serving as the source of data items.
   :param transform_func: The function that is used to extract the model's input
       from the data item. The data item here is the data item that is returned from
       the data source per iteration. This function should be passed when
       the data item cannot be directly used as model's input. If this is not specified, then the data item
       will be passed into the model as-is.

   .. py:method:: get_data(indices = None)

      Returns the iterable object that contains selected data items from the data source as-is.

      :param indices: The zero-based indices of data items that should be selected from
          the data source. The indices should be sorted in ascending order. If indices are
          not passed all data items are selected from the data source.
      :return: The iterable object that contains selected data items from the data source as-is.


   .. py:method:: get_inference_data(indices = None)

      Returns the iterable object that contains selected data items from the data source, for which
      the transformation function was applied. The item, which was returned per iteration from this
      iterable, can be used as the model's input for model inference.

      :param indices: The zero-based indices of data items that should be selected from
          the data source. The indices should be sorted in ascending order. If indices are
          not passed all data items are selected from the data source.
      :return: The iterable object that contains selected data items from the data source, for which
          the transformation function was applied.



.. py:class:: ModelType

   Bases: :py:obj:`enum.Enum`

   Describes the model type the specificity of which will be taken into account during compression.

   :param TRANSFORMER: Transformer-based models
       (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)


.. py:class:: TargetDevice

   Bases: :py:obj:`enum.Enum`

   Target device architecture for compression.

   Compression will take into account the value of this parameter in order to obtain the best performance
   for this type of device.


.. py:class:: QuantizationPreset

   Bases: :py:obj:`enum.Enum`

   An enum with values corresponding to the available quantization presets.


.. py:function:: quantize(model, calibration_dataset, preset = QuantizationPreset.PERFORMANCE, target_device = TargetDevice.ANY, subset_size = 300, fast_bias_correction = True, model_type = None, ignored_scope = None, advanced_parameters = None)

         quantization of activations.
   :type  preset: nncf.QuantizationPreset

       statistics used for quantization.

       more time but requires less memory.

       in the model. Supported only `transformer` now.
   :type  model_type: Optional[nncf.ModelType]

.. py:function:: quantize_with_accuracy_control(model, calibration_dataset, validation_dataset, validation_fn, max_drop = 0.01, preset = QuantizationPreset.PERFORMANCE, target_device = TargetDevice.ANY, subset_size = 300, fast_bias_correction = True, model_type = None, ignored_scope = None, advanced_quantization_parameters = None, advanced_accuracy_restorer_parameters = None)

.. py:class:: IgnoredScope

   Provides an option to specify portions of model to be excluded from compression.

   The ignored scope defines model sub-graphs that should be excluded from the compression process such as
   quantization, pruning and etc.

   Example:

   ..  code-block:: python

           import nncf

           # Exclude by node name:
           node_names = ['node_1', 'node_2', 'node_3']
           ignored_scope = nncf.IgnoredScope(names=node_names)

           # Exclude using regular expressions:
           patterns = ['node_\d']
           ignored_scope = nncf.IgnoredScope(patterns=patterns)

           # Exclude by operation type:

           # OpenVINO opset https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_ops_opset.html
           operation_types = ['Multiply', 'GroupConvolution', 'Interpolate']
           ignored_scope = nncf.IgnoredScope(types=operation_types)

           # ONNX opset https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md
           operation_types = ['Mul', 'Conv', 'Resize']
           ignored_scope = nncf.IgnoredScope(types=operation_types)

   **Note:** Operation types must be specified according to the model framework.

   :param names: List of ignored node names.
   :type names: List[str]
   :param patterns: List of regular expressions that define patterns for names of ignored nodes.
   :type patterns: List[str]
   :param types: List of ignored operation types.
   :type types: List[str]
